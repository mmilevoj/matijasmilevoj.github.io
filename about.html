            <p>Motivated and driven. Works in gastronomy but his passion is in programming language Javascript. He never even thought
                of programming languages untill the first year of college where he first meet with C++ . While it was interesting,
                the need of independency drew him on a total different path. Today, 7 years later he is accomplished in one way,
                but knows his true goal is yet to be accomplished. Nothing will stop him to become a full time front end developer.</p>
